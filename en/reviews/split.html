      <p>A GREAT game.</p>
      <p>It's an small story (about 45min-55min), where you will navegate directories, open files and type 'help' because you forget the commands.</p>
      <p>It's indeed very very short, it leaves me wanting to solve a few more puzzles, or at leaste, browse a couple more files. Anymay, I still recommend it. It costs 2 bucks, you won't event buy a Coke with that (at least in Argentina, lol).</p>
      <p>If I have to keep a thing from this one (and from this artist), it's its IMPRESSIVE and FASCINATING aesthetic. It creates an atmosphere that few games have, immersing you fully in the stories it tells.</p>
      <p>I really really really hope he decides to tell a longer story, his games always fell short for me. I need more of his sci-fi drug.</p>
      <p>I'm leaving a couple of screenshots that I take during my hacking session.</p>
      <p>Have a nice day!</p>
