GRAN Juego.
A GREAT game.
It's an small story (about 45min-55min), where you will navegate directories, open files and type 'help' because you
forget the commands.

It's indeed very very short, it leaves me wanting to solve a few more puzzles, or at leaste, browse a couple more files.
Anymay, I still recommend it. It costs 2 bucks, you won't event buy a Coke with that (at least in Argentina, lol).

If I have to keep a thing from this one (and from this artist), it's its IMPRESSIVE and FASCINATING aesthetic. It
creates an atmosphere that few
games have, immersing you fully in the stories it tells.
I really really really hope he decides to tell a longer story, his games always fell short for me. I need more of his
sci-fi drug.

I'm leaving a couple of screenshots that I take during my hacking session.

Have a nice day!
